# OpenCode: Design & Branding Identity (SV 2026 Edition)

Welcome to the future. OpenCode isn't just a tool; it's the "Tactical Command Center" for the AI-Native developer.

## 🎨 The Aesthetic: "Neo-Tactical"

In 2026, Silicon Valley has moved past the "Clean & Minimal" look. Everything is now high-fidelity, high-density, and tactile.

### 🌓 The Color Palette: "Obsidian & Neon"
- **Primary Base**: `#0A0A0B` (Deep Space Black) - More ink, less grey.
- **Accents**: 
  - `#00FF9C` (Bio-Digital Green) - For "Success" and "Agent Running" states.
  - `#FF006E` (Synthetic Magenta) - For "Warning" and "Manual Override."
  - `#3A86FF` (Hyper-Blue) - For "Context Suggestions" and "AI Thinking."
- **Glassmorphism**: 15% opacity overlays with heavy `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` for all floating panels.

### ⌨️ Typography: "Variable Brutalism"
- **UI Font**: `JetBrains Mono` or `Inter Variable` (High contrast, tight tracking).
- **Code Font**: `Berkeley Mono` or `Input Mono` (Custom-ligature-heavy).

## 🏗️ UI Components: "The Bento Shell"

OpenCode uses a **Bento Grid** layout for metadata, while the code remains a "Sacred Canvas."

1. **The Ghost Terminal**: A semi-transparent overlay at the bottom that shows the AI "thinking" in real-time logs.
2. **The Context Orb**: A pulsating 3D glow in the status bar that changes color based on how well the AI "understands" the current file (Green = Fully Indexed, Yellow = Partial, Blue = Indexing).
3. **The Shadow Diff**: Instead of red/green blocks, changes appear as "Ghost Text" with a subtle glow that fades in when the AI proposes an edit.

## ⚡ The Vibe: "High-Agency & Transparent"

- **Tactile Sound Effects**: Subtle, low-frequency clicks when the AI accepts a goal. No high-pitched beeps.
- **Terminal First**: Everything the AI does is logged in a "History" tab that looks like a mission-critical flight recorder.
- **No Mystery**: Every "Magic" action has a "Show Source" button that reveals the exact prompt and context used.
